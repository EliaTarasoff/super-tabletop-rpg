## Exp for Players
- Players should start with maybe 50 exp.
- Give out maybe 10-20 exp after each session to each of your players.
- If your players are nice and helpful, and give you story-beats they want to act out,
  to make it easier for you to think up the next game session's story, reward them with exp.
    - You just set up the scenes, but it's still up to your players to achieve their goals.
      (If they fail, maybe give them like, half exp.)
    - Major story-beats (difficult to achieve) maybe like 5 exp.
    - Minor story beats (easier to achieve) maybe like 2 exp.
    - Maybe limit the players to one major and two minor per session?
      Otherwise they'll max out their species' and role's abilities after only a few sessions.
    - But like, if you're only running a short campaign, then it doesn't matter - they'll be super-heroes by the end!
