## Creating a Player-Character
1. Choose a species.
1. Choose a role.
1. Think up a cool backstory.
1. Spend starting-exp between your species and role as feels appropriate.
    1. You must buy at least one ability from your species and your role.
    1. You start with 50 exp.
    1. Abilities for both (normal) species and roles cost 10 exp.
1. Draw a nice portrait for yourself!

## Using Abilities
- Abilities get marked with a `>` to denote expending effort.
- If the ability says "damage", then mark it with an `X` instead.
- Any time you take damage, you must mark abilities as damaged,
  with one `X` per point of damage. You may distribute it as you see fit.
- Fully-damaged abilities provide no benefit and cannot be activated.
- Spent abilities refresh with normal food, sleep, or readily-found supplies.
- Damaged abilities need special healing, repairs or supplies.
- _(Swan Song)_ abilities may be used when you have taken at least
  75% damage. (Or instantly, if an attack or ability would drop you to 0%.)
  Then you're dead. :)
- _(The Bomb)_ abilities may be used at any time after they have been
  purchased with exp. You die after using them.

## Leveling Up Characters
- DMs should give out maybe like 10-20 exp after each session.
    - Players are strongly encouraged to give their DM
      a major story-beat they want to hit for each 10 exp,
      or minor story-beats for each 5 exp.
        - This helps the DM give you a story you're interested in, and
          reduce their work-load to prepare for each session.
- Abilities for both (normal) species and roles still cost 10 exp.
