## Description
Your species evolved with terrific sand-storms - you are resistant to piercing
and slashing, but weak to blunt damage. You also have bioluminescent eyes,
to communicate over long distances.

## Abilities
### Burly Claws
Your claws and arms are extra strong, letting you grapple, pinch and punch really hard!
(Crushing extra-hard things like steel and rock expends this ability.)

### Roly Poly
You can curl into a ball and roll around like a giant wheel! So fast!
(Curling and uncurling to protect your underside takes no effort, but
rolling at speed expends this ability.)

### Tough Teeth, Sturdy Stomach
You've got extra-strong teeth and stomach, letting you eat things other animals
cannot, such as wood, stone, feces or bone. Don't waste a thing!
(Normal food is free, but tough stuff expends this ability.)

### Fire and Shrapnel
_(The Bomb)_
Your innards consume themselves in a runaway thermal reaction -
you explode in a blaze of fire and shrapnel, in a short radius.
