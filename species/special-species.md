## Human
You are a generic, weak, smelly ape-person from a back-water world.
You have no innate abilities, but when you gain skills, languages, etc
they are discounted by one-quarter.

## Chimera
Whether by holy gift, unholy magics, or mad science, you have the
body-parts of many different species.
You may gain abilities from any species, as long as you meet the necessary
prerequisites, but you pay one-fifth extra price.
_(Abilities with the same name in different species don't count!)_
Additionally, you may choose:

### Silver Tongue
You may be understood by any creature with which you share a body-part.
(Always active.)
Slots: [ ]

### Golden Ear
You may understand any creature with which you share a body-part.
