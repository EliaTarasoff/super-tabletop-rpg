## Human
You are a generic, weak, smelly ape-person from a back-water world.
You have no innate abilities, but can gain skills, languages, etc
at a one-third discount.

## Chimera
Whether by holy gift, unholy magics, or mad science, you have the
body-parts of many different species.
You may gain abilities from any species, as long as you meet the necessary
prerequisites. (Abilities with the same name in different species don't count!)
