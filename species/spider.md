## Description

## Abilities
### Glob Lob
Launch a blob of gluey silk to entangle your enemies!

### Climbing Cable
Shoot a long strand of silk, that attaches to the surface it strikes. 
It can be climbed by your easily, and you may glue its other end securely.

### Crawly Climber
You've got extra-sticky hands and feet -
you can climb up vertical surfaces and even across ceilings!

### Heat Hunter
Some of your eyes can see heat, letting you see warm objects in the dark!
(Or cooler objects in the warm day.)

### Poison Fangs
Your fangs can inject poison into your enemies, paralyzing and
slowly liquefying them. (Eating them is optional.)

### Tunnel Trap
You spin a barely-perceptible, spring-loaded web on the circumference of a doorway or tunnel.
When stepped on, it snaps shut ensnaring the person and blocking further passage.
