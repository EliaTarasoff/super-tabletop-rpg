Your larvae burst out of your exoskeleton, ready to devour you and whatever

and after those enemies' next action, strip their flesh from their bones.
After the next two actions, they chew anythiing in a medium radius,
then burrow into the ground to pupate.

When stepped on, it snaps shut ensnaring the person and blocking further passage.
