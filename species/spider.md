It can be climbed by your easily, and you may glue its other end securely.

Your extra hands and feet let you easily climb walls, grapple and wield more!

### Heat Hunter
Some of your eyes can see heat, letting you see warm objects in the dark!
(Or cooler objects in the warm day.)

### Poison Fangs
Your fangs can inject poison into your enemies, paralyzing and
slowly liquefying them. (Eating them is optional.)

You spin a barely-perceptible, spring-loaded web on the circumference of a doorway or tunnel.
