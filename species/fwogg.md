### Birthing Balloon
_(Swan Song)_
When you die, you inflate yourself with lighter-than-air gases,
to float on the wind until you land in a new pond, dropping your tadpoles.
You may optionally attach yourself to the ground with your tongue,
to let your allies use you as a lifting-balloon, or attach to an enemy
to float them far, far away.
