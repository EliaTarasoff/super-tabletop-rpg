## Abilities
### Amazing Carpentry
You're very skilled at wood-working and paper-craft, and always have some
materials with you. Spending a slot lets you build a small thing out of wood,
or a large thing out of paper.
(Damaging a slot uses up the limited resources in your pack.)

### Light as a Feather
You are extra small and light, allowing you to glide long distances,
and fly short distances. You also climb much more quickly and easily!
(Gliding and climbing does not use up slots.)

### Sweet Treats
You slurp up extra nectar, to produce honey-balls -
tasty treats for yourself or any allies!
Each one provides nutrition for one day and refreshes two ability slots,
or heals one damaged ability slot using up its nutritive properties.
The number you can produce is dependent on your location.
