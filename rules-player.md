## Creating a Character to Play
1. Choose a species.
1. Choose a role.
1. Think up a cool backstory.
1. Buy abilities for your species and role as feels appropriate.
    1. You must buy at least one ability for your species and for your role.
    1. Your GM will tell your how much exp you start with.
    1. Abilities for species and roles cost 10 exp.
1. Draw a nice portrait for yourself!

## Using Abilities
- Abilities get marked with a `>` to denote expending effort.
- If the ability says "damage", then mark it with an `X` instead.
- Any time you take damage, you must mark abilities as damaged,
  with one `X` per point of damage. You may distribute it as you see fit.
- Fully-damaged abilities provide no benefit and cannot be activated.
- Spent abilities refresh with normal food, sleep, or readily-found supplies.
- Damaged abilities need special healing, repairs or supplies.
- _(Swan Song)_ abilities may be used when you have taken at least
  75% damage. (Or instantly, if an attack or ability would drop you to 0%.)
  Then you're dead. :)
- _(The Bomb)_ abilities may be used at any time after they have been
  purchased with exp. You die after using them.

## Leveling Up Your Character
- Your GM will give you some amount of exp after each game session.
- Spend this the same way as when you created your character.
- If you give your GM some story-beats that you'd like to act out with your character,
  it'll make their job a bit easier, when extending the story for future sessions.
    - Major story-beats are goals or actions that are difficult to achieve, but have a larger impact on the story.
        - For example, you assassinate the king's advisor, and wound the king.
    - Minor story-beats are goals or actions that are easier to achieve, but have a smaller impact on the story.
        - For example, you rescue a family of villagers from bandits, or
        - you trap and kill a mutant wolf that's hunting a village's sheep.
- If you run out of abilities to buy for your species and role, take an extra role!
