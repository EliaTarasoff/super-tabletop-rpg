## Description

## Abilities
### Dance to the Dead
_(The Bomb)_
This is your last song and dance. You pirouette and sway towards your target,
castanets tossed into the air, fading into the great beyond.
Your voice is joined by a seeming chorus of lost souls,
as you move faster and faster with furious crescendo.
At the climax, you embrace your dance partner and walk into the afterlife...
