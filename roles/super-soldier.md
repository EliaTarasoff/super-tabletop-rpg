## Description
You don't remember the details of how you became an experimental soldier
in a foreign army, or the details of the wars you fought, but when you came to
you were 1) somewhere you didn't like, 2) had a weapon drawn
on a family of farmers, and 3) got the hell out of dodge.
After you stole your own secret formulae from your former owner's alchemists,
a crate of supplies, and loaded it all on a cart.
Plus a good amount of gold and gems to pay your way and help rebuild
the villages of those who you wronged.
