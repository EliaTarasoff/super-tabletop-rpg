If you want to get abilities from another role, it costs you extra.
The second role you take has its costs increased by one fifth,
the third by one quarter, the fourth by one third, and the fifth by one half.

It is recommended that you role-play your character as eccentric, forgetful,
scatterbrained, etc, because they clogged their brain up with so much information.
Or act like "jack of all trades, master of none", and penalize your rolls.
