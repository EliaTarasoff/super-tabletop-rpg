## Dice
1. Don't roll dice for easy things.
1. The highest die determines your outcome.
1. Add dice for each skill, language, equipment, advantageous environment, etc.
1. Add one extra die if an ally is able to assist.
1. Subtract dice for difficulty, if you are surrounded by enemies, etc.
1. If you would roll less than one die, instead roll that many extra dice,
   but look at the lowest die instead.
