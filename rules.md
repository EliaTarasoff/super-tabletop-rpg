## Dice
1. Don't roll dice for easy things.
1. The highest die determines your outcome.
1. Add dice for each skill, language, equipment, advantageous environment, etc.
1. Add one extra die if an ally is able to assist.
1. Subtract dice for difficulty, if you are surrounded by enemies, etc.
1. If you would roll less than one die, instead roll that many extra dice,
   but look at the lowest die instead.

| Roll | Outcome            |
|------|--------------------|
| 6    | Complete success.  |
| 5    | Success at a cost. |
| 4    | Success at a cost. |
| 3    | Abject failure.    |
| 2    | Abject failure.    |
| 1    | Abject failure.    |

## Creating a Player-Character
1. Choose a species.
1. Choose a role.
1. Think up a cool backstory.
1. Spend starting-exp between your species and role as feels appropriate.
    1. You start with 50 exp.
    1. Abilities for both (normal) species and roles cost 10 exp.
1. Draw a nice portrait for yourself!

## Using Abilities
- Abilities get marked with a `>` to denote expending effort.
- If the ability says "damage", then mark it with an `X` instead.
- Any time you take damage, you must mark abilities as damaged,
  with one `X` per point of damage. You may distribute it as you see fit.
- Fully-damaged abilities provide no benefit and cannot be activated.
- Spent abilities refresh with normal food, sleep, or readily-found supplies.
- Damaged abilities need special healing, repairs or supplies.
- _(Swan Song)_ abilities may be used when you have taken at least
  75% damage. (Or instantly, if an attack or ability would drop you to 0%.)
  Then you're dead. :)
- _(The Bomb)_ abilities may be used at any time after they have been
  purchased with exp. You die after using them.

## Leveling Up Characters
- DMs should give out maybe like 10-20 exp after each session.
    - Players are strongly encouraged to give their DM
      a major story-beat they want to hit for each 10 exp,
      or minor story-beats for each 5 exp.
        - This helps the DM give you a story you're interested in, and
          reduce their work-load to prepare for each session.
- Abilities for both (normal) species and roles still cost 10 exp.

## Glossary
- **Spend:** tick an ability slot.
- **Damage:** mark an ability slot with an `X`.
- **Refresh:** un-tick a spent ability slot.
- **Heal:** un-`X` a damaged ability slot.
- Poison: anyone afflicted with this takes P damage after one action,
  P-1 damage after their next action...and 1 damage after P actions.
  (This is a lot of damage - a total of `((P * (P-1)) / 2) + P`.)
- Corrode/Burning: anyone afflicted with this takes one damage after each action,
  and reduces the corrode/fire by one. (It's done at zero.)
- Knockout gas: like poison, but expends slots instead of damaging them.
