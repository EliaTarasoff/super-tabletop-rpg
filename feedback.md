- Give failures some "at a cost" like the "success at a cost".
    - otherwise the failures are just boring w/o any other things going on
- will there be any abilities with resistance to damage types? e.g. take half damage from slashing
    - ET: I still need to figure out damage, let alone resistance
      I think I have one species with this built-in?

- negative outcome damage????
- good
    - skills clear
    - damage easy
- improve
    - +/- for actions unclear
    - damage over time rules are missing
