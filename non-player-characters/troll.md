## Description
Trolls are a reclusive, peaceful, intelligent species.
There are occasional reports of a troll that has learned to speak a human language
such as English, but these are difficult to confirm.
The trolls have been observed speaking to each other in their own language,
but without being able to observe them up close, not much is known about it.

Trolls turn to stone in sunlight; It is thought that this is a defensive mechanism,
to protect themselves from wolves or other predators.
When in underground caves, they do not turn to stone at any time of day.
There have been reports of troll encampments in cave systems, but
these are often gone by the time another person comes to verify it.
Because of this, trolls are thought to be nomadic.
