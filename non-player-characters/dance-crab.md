## Description
The dancing crab (cancri saltationis) is an energetic, harmless species.
Found in tropical beaches, they communicate through a complex series of
pincer-clicks, pincer- and leg-waving, and rhythmic jumps and bounces.
(A group can often be induced to dance if you play electronic music.)
